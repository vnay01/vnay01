I am Vinay, from India and currently, Sweden is my new home! 

I have always been interested in electronics and this has led me to explore the field of Application Specific Integrated Circuits ( TLDR:  ASIC ) so here I am at the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University for a Master's degree in Embedded Electronics Engineering with a specialization in System-on-Chip Design.

I have experience in mapping algorithms to hardware and FPGA prototyping. 
During the course of 2021-22, I have developed skills in Digital IC design, DSP design, and performance improvements using pipelining and parallelism ( thanks to projects from the university and some voluntary practice at home! ) 


I am also curious about security in hardware, which has led me to take a course in Cryptography at my university. My plan is to take the learnings from this course and evaluate their performance on hardware( i.e. throughput, latency, Area, power, etc. )

## Skills: 
-  Hardware Description Languages: VHDL, Verilog
- High Level Synthesis: System C
- Coding: C, Python
- Sripting: TCL, Bash
- Modelling: MATLAB
- EDA: Cadence Digital Flow tools
- FPGA boards: Xilinx's Ultrascale+ Family of SoC boards(ZCU216, ZCU211 , KRIA KV260)

## What am I doing now!?

- ðŸ”­ Working on Hardware Accelerator design and implementation targeted for the signal processing chain of a digital beamforming device.
- ðŸŒ± Learning algorithms, RISC-V and other cool stuff.
- ðŸ‘¯ ~~Iâ€™m looking for a master thesis in implementation of 5G DSP chain~~
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: vnay01@gmail.com or drop me a message on LinkedIn

## âš¡ Fun fact: 
I can mix cool cocktails
